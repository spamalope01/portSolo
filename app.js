// i'm going to need a constructor.  I want to create a slideshow of projects that i've done.  each slide in the slideshow will represent a single project.  so the constructor is going to need things like: title, author, date published to the web, client name, description, languages/technologies used.  i can add to that later if i think of other qualities.

// next i'll need...maybe not a prototype, but some function that pushes items through the constructor so that my slideshow can populate.

// finally, naturally, i'll have to call these functions at the bottom like we did with the blog project.
